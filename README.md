### Now this project is unfinished.And it will be done in two weeks(2014-12-29).

This is a simulation of inverse reinforcement learning

The GUI of this program is based on pygame.

To run this program, you need:

1. install pygame
2. install numpy

Steps to run the experiment:

1. run `python run_export_demo.py` to create a demo for the agent
2. run `python run_irl`. Then the agent will act like what you do just now.
